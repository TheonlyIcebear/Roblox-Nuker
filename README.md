# Roblox-Nuker
A nuker for Roblox accounts. Made by Ice Bear#0167.
# Usage
I would recommend running in replit (https://replit.com) as it is deprecated in windows and the text appear strangly
But If you are going to run in windows you'll need Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
And have pip installed as well (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ko9b_vC6XY0)
Then run the batch called install.bat
# Disclaimer
Do not use this tool without permission from the account owner. I am not liable for any improper use of this tool as it is open source.
The tool doesn't actually use the proxies and I realized this half way through coding this but it doesn't really affect performance so whatever.
Not only that but there is a issue with making post requests in the requests module because the proxy needs to be https and fully functional which are hard to come by
